Introduction

BASH : Bash is a command language interpreter. It is widely available on various operating systems and is a default 
command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell
# echo $SHELL

SHELL : Shell is a macro processor which allows for an interactive or non-interactive command execution.

SCRIPTING: Scripting allows for an automatic commands execution that would otherwise be executed interactively one-by-one

SCRIPT: Is an executable file that contains a set of commands to automate a specific task. And it is a way to 
automate tasks in LINUX.

BASH SCRIPT: is a text file containing a series of commands. Any command that can be executed in the terminal can be put into a Bash script. 
Any series of commands to be executed in the terminal can be written in a text file, in that order, as a Bash script.:

Anything you can run normally on the command line can be put into a script and it will do exactly the same thing. 
Similarly, anything you can put into a script can also be run normally on the command line and it will do exactly the same thing.

Advantages
The syntax and command are approx the same as those directly entered in command line so developer or 
programmer does not face much problem in implementation. 
Let see the advantages of the bash shell as given below.

1: Writing a shell script is faster and quicker.
2: Quick start
3: Interactive debugging is available

Disadvantages
1: Extra care is required to eliminate harmful circumstances.
2: Usually, the execution speed is slow.
3: There are many flaws with respect to design and implementation.
4: It gives very little data structure facilities with respect to other scripting languages like Python.
