Project1: At work we have to deccomissione servers sometimes. and to that new contractors have to run some commands to do a full inventory of the system/box/hardware/server. Everytime we run into issues where contractor dont know which commands to type. So I decided to write a script to do it.

sol:
touch inventory.sh
chmod +x inventory.sh

#!/bin/bash

echo "Number of cpu's"
nproc
echo "Os Version"
cat /etc/*release
echo "Hard drive(s)"
lsblk
echo "Memory info"
free -m 
echo "Cpu info"
lscpu
cat /proc/cpuinfo

Variables:
a viriable in shell is a string that carries a value. that value can be called many times in the script.

example

FIRST_NAME=Serge 

$FIRST_NAME ==> Serge 
${FIRST_NAME} ==> Serge

NB: when the value of a variable is the output of a command, we need to put use the grave accent to enclose the command. 

example: 

NUMBER_CPU=`nproc`  or NUMBER_CPU=$(nproc)

$NUMBER_CPU ==> the output of nproc command

we have system default variable and variable declare by the admin.
to check system variables we run env or printenv command
to create a system variable, we use the export command.

example:
export CPU=2
