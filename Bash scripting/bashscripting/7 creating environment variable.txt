Creating an environment variable

To create an environment variable, we use: 
# export VarNAme=Value

Example: Let’s create an environment variable called TMPDIR that will 
carry the /tmp directory path. 

# export TMPDIR=/tmp

◇ Check with # env and you will see a new variable created
◇ Now, even if the system is rebooted, the variable will still be there.

To unset it, you can use: # unset TMPDIR

◇ Check back in # env: It is no more there!
